   **Project name**
   
   Psychophysiological data from Mexican children with learning difficulties who strengthen reading and math skills by assistive technology
   
   
   **Year that the project ran**
   
   2023
                                                                                                                       
   
   **Brief overview of the tasks in the experiment**
   
   
   The current dataset consists of psychometric and electrophysiological data from children with reading or math learning difficulties. These data were collected to evaluate improvements in reading or math skills resulting from using an online learning method called Smartick. 
   
   The psychometric evaluations from children with reading difficulties encompassed: spelling tests, where 1) orthographic and 2) phonological errors were considered, 3) reading speed, expressed in words read per minute, and 4) reading comprehension, where multiple-choice questions were given to the children. The last 2 parameters were determined according to the `standards from the Ministry of Public Education <https://rarchivoszona33.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/manual_fomento.pdf>`__ (Secretaría de Educación Pública in Spanish) in Mexico. On the other hand, group 2 assessments embraced: 1) an assessment of general mathematical knowledge, as well as 2) the hits percentage, and 3) reaction time from an arithmetical task. Additionally, selective attention and intelligence quotient (IQ) were also evaluated.
   
   Then, individuals underwent an EEG experimental paradigm where two conditions were recorded: 1) a 3-minute eyes-open resting state and 2) performing either reading or mathematical activities. EEG recordings from the reading experiment consisted of reading a text aloud and then answering questions about the text. Alternatively, EEG recordings from the math experiment involved the solution of two blocks with 20 arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction). Subsequently, each child was randomly subcategorized as 1) the experimental group, who were asked to engage with Smartick for three months, and 2) the control group, who were not involved with the intervention. Once the 3-month period was over, every child was reassessed as described before.
                                                                                                       
   
   **Description of the contents of the dataset**
   
   
   The dataset contains a total of 76 *subjects* **(sub-)**, where two study groups were assessed: 1) *reading difficulties* **(R)** and 2) *math difficulties* **(M)**. Then, each individual was subcategorized as *experimental subgroup* **(e)**, where children were compromised to engage with Smartick, or *control subgroup*  **(c)**, where they did not get involved with any intervention.
   
   Every subject was followed up on for three months. During this period, each subject underwent two EEG sessions, representing the *PRE-intervention* **(ses-1)** and the *POST-intervention* **(ses-2)**. 
   
   The EEG recordings from the reading difficulties group consisted of a *resting state condition* **(run-1)** and while performing *active reading and reading comprehension activities* **(run-2)**. On the other hand, EEG data from the math difficulties group was collected from a *resting state condition* **(run-1)** and when *solving two blocks of 20 arithmetic operations* **(run-2 and run-3)**. All EEG files were stored in .set format. The nomenclature and description from filenames are shown below:

   |              run-3                  |  EEG for the second block of math|

   Tecnologico de Monterrey. Av. Eugenio Garza Sada 2501 Sur, Tecnologico, 64849 Monterrey, N.L., Mexico.
                                                                             
   
   **Missing data**
   
   The file ***2. EEG Data Descriptor.xlsx*** describes the data availability for EEG recordings. Some cells are highlighted to indicate some situations:
   - Yellow cells mean that the quality of the EEG signals is inconsistent. However, EEG files were included for EEG preprocessing purposes. Additionally, EEG events for these files were not exported.
   - Red cells imply that data is unavailable due to technical problems during the experiment's run and saving.                                                                                    
   
   
   **Notes**
   
   EEG signals were filtered online with a 0.1-100 Hz bandpass filter.
   The electrode O2 showed technical issues during the EEG experiment. The authors suggest the interpolation of this electrode
