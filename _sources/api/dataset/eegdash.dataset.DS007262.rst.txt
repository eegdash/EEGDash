Description
-----------

This dataset was generated from LSL/XDF recordings. Converted to bids with instructions and code `presented here <https://github.com/LMBooth/QT-arithmetic_study/tree/main/conversion_package>`__

- Original recordings are stored under sourcedata/xdf/ as .xdf files (non-BIDS).
- EEG was converted to BrainVision format (.vhdr/.eeg/.vmrk) under each sub-*/eeg/.
- *_events.tsv was generated from marker streams and then aligned so onset is relative to the EEG start time.
- Marker streams include task markers (arithmetic-Markers) and acquisition dropout annotations (UoHDataOffsetStream); events include a marker_stream column and marker definitions are in task-arithmetic_events.json.
- Pupil Labs gaze/pupil data was exported from the XDF pupil_capture stream into sub-*/eeg/ as eyetrack physio files (*_recording-eyetrack_physio.tsv.gz + *_recording-eyetrack_physio.json; PhysioType=eyetrack).
- ECG is captured on the EEG system; the ECG channel is typed in *_channels.tsv and exported as *_recording-ecg_physio.tsv.gz + *_recording-ecg_physio.json.
- ML analysis note: participants excluded from the ML analysis remain in participants.tsv with analysis_included=false; no epoch rejection was applied to this raw dataset.
- Participant IDs match the original XDF filenames; missing IDs correspond to excluded participants.

   Participants
   - N_recorded: 20
   - N_released: 18
   - Exclusions: 2 participants excluded due to multi-modal acquisition failures (sub-002, sub-017).
   - Demographics in participants.tsv: age (years), sex, handedness.
   - Excluded IDs remain in participants.tsv with analysis_included=false.
   
   Hardware and data collection
   - Combined EEG+ECG mobile EEG system (Bateson and Asghar, 2021; Clewett et al., 2016) and Pupil Labs Pupil Core, synchronized via Lab Streaming Layer (LSL).
   - EEG: 19-channel 10-20 montage (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2), Ag/AgCl electrodes with linked-ear reference, 250 Hz; impedances checked and Neurgel EEG gel applied.
   - ECG: 3-lead on the same system; positive lead right shoulder/clavicle, negative lead left shoulder/clavicle, feedback lead lower left torso.
   - Pupillometry: Pupil Labs Pupil Core eye tracking with infrared illuminators; LSL relay with asynchronous sampling (timestamps per sample).
   
   Protocol summary
   - Arithmetic task difficulty was defined using Q-value ranges and randomized order across trials.
   - Task events encode difficulty in `trial_type` and `difficulty_range` (e.g.,baseline, 0.6-1.5, 1.5-2.4, ..., 6.0-6.9).
   - Baseline for 60 seconds and then 70 questions, 10 at each difficulty level presented for 6 seconds each.
   Task: arithmetic
   
   Release notes
   - Recorded 20 participants; released 18.
   - Reason: multi-modal acquisition QC failure.
   - Participant IDs match original XDF filenames; missing IDs indicate excluded participants.
