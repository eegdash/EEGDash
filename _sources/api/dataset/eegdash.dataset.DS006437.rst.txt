Description
-----------

LIGHT Dataset                             

During these guided imagery hypnotherapy sessions,   
a hypnotherapist integrates storytelling and deep    
visualizations techniques to encourage personal      
and wellbeing. This method allows individuals to     
explore and modify their subconscious narratives, in 
order to foster changes that resonate through their  
lives. This differs from traditional hypnotherapy    
by tapping into eudaemonic aspects of well-being,

   LIGHT Dataset                             
   
   During these guided imagery hypnotherapy sessions,   
   a hypnotherapist integrates storytelling and deep    
   visualizations techniques to encourage personal      
   and wellbeing. This method allows individuals to     
   explore and modify their subconscious narratives, in 
   order to foster changes that resonate through their  
   lives. This differs from traditional hypnotherapy    
   by tapping into eudaemonic aspects of well-being,    
   emphasizing the pursuit of meaning and self          
   realization.                                         
   
   2 weeks before the first session, they will come to  
   the lab to record baseline resting EEG (session 0).  
   With the exception of sessions 1, 4, and 8, all LIGHT
   sessions were performed virtually. For sessions 1,   
   4, and 8, EEG and ECG data was collected.            
   The first phase of each session was guided relaxation
   or induction followed by prompts to visualize a      
   perfect place of comfort and safely in ones creative 
   imagination. Next, they were prompted to visualize   
   a path or a set of stairs, and asked to walk down    
   that path or stairway for ten steps, counting down   
   from 10 to 1 outloud. They were guided to visualize  
   and describe a chair or seat, followed by a crown.   
   After taking a seat in their imagined chair and      
   putting on the crown, they were encouraged to pause  
   and observe the world they had conjured. Following   
   this brief period of reflection, awareness was drawn 
   to a light or color that emerged from their creative 
   mind. They identified the color of the light and     
   were instructed to imagine that light entering and   
   traveling through their body, filling up each cell   
   as it passed through. The participant was instructed 
   to leave a mental bookmark in this place so that     
   they could come back to it at any time, before       
   removing and storing their crown. At the end of the  
   LIGHT sessions, the participant was asked to rise    
   from their imagined chair or throne and count their  
   way up from one to ten, with the session ending as   
   the participant returned to an awake and alert state 
   at the end of the ten count.
   
   Baseline recordings were 5 minute of length.         
   Hypnotherapy recordings are variable in length with  
   multiple events indicating a hypnotherapist phase    
   transitions.
