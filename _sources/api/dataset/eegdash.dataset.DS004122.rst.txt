   **BCIT Speed Control**
   
   
   **Introduction**
   
   **Overview:** The Speed Control study was designed to collect extended time-on-task measurements of subjects
   performing a driving task in a simulated environment in order to assess fatigue-based performance
   through novel biomarkers. Similar to the Baseline Driving study, the Speed Control study was intended
   to identify periods of driver fatigue via predictive algorithms formulated from the analysis of driver
   EEG data, in comparison to the objective performance measures, and in contrast with the (non-fatigued)
   Calibration driving session for the subject. Speed Control extended the paradigm by modulating driver
   control of the throttle and increasing the frequency and magnitude of perturbation events vs. Baseline Driving.
   Further information is available on request from `cancta.net <https://cancta.net>`__.
   
   **Methods**
   
   **Subjects:** Volunteers from the local community recruited through advertisements.
   **Apparatus:**  Driving simulator with steering wheel and brake / foot pedals (Real Time Technologies; Dearborn, MI);
   Video Refresh Rate (VRR) = 900 Hz; Vehicle data log file Sampling Rate (SR) = 100 Hz);
   EEG (BioSemi 64 (+8) channel systems with 4 eye and 2 mastoid channels recorded; SR=2048 Hz);
   Eye Tracking (Sensomotoric Instruments (SMI); REDEYE250). Eye tracking data is not included with this dataset.
   **Initial setup:** Upon arrival to the lab, subjects were given an introduction to the primary study
   for which they were recruited and provided informed consent and provided demographics information.
   This was followed by a practice session, to acclimate the subject to the driving simulator.
   The driving practice task lasted 10-15 min, until asymptotic performance in steering and speed
   control was demonstrated and lack of motion sickness was reported. Subjects were then outfitted
   and prepped for eye tracking and EEG acquisition.
   **Task organization:** Subjects performed the Speed Control condition A and Speed Control condition B,
   with counter-balancing used across subjects as to which of them came first.
   Speed Control A was 45 minutes of continuous driving, with subjects responsible for steering control,
   with the simulator maintaining a constant speed automatically.
   Speed Control B was similar, but the subject was responsible for both steering and maintaining speed.
   Both driving tasks were conducted on the same simulated long, straight road.
   In each case, the subject was instructed to stay within the boundaries of the right-most lane,
   and to drive at the posted speed limits. The vehicle was periodically subject to lateral perturbing forces,
   which could be applied to either side of the vehicle, pushing the vehicle out of the center of the lane;
   and the subject was instructed to execute corrective steering actions to return the vehicle to the center of the lane.
   **Independent variables:** Speed Control (cruise vs. manual).
   **Dependent variables:** Reaction times to perturbations, continuous performance based on vehicle log
   (steering wheel angle, lane position, heading error, etc.), Task-Induced Fatigue Scale (TIFS),
   Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Visual Analog Scale of Fatigue (VAS-F).
   **Note:** questionnaire data is available upon request from `cancta.net <https://cancta.net>`__.
   **Additional data acquired:** Participant Enrollment Questionnaire, Subject Questionnaire for Current Session,
   Simulator Sickness Questionnaire.
   **Experimental Locations:** Teledyne Corporation, Durham, NC.
   **Note:** This dataset has a corresponding dataset in the BCIT Calibration Driving ds004118 which has the
   15 minute driving task performed prior to this one.
