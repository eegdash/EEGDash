About This Dataset
------------------

This dataset contains de-identified resting-state EEG recordings from individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and age-matched healthy control subjects. All EEG data were recorded using standard clinical EEG systems at Neurology Clinic.
Dataset Purpose:
This dataset was originally used to evaluate whether resting-state EEG can help distinguish subjects who were later deceased from those who remained living (mortality classification). Only de-identified EEG data and mortality labels are included.

Participant Information:
- Participants are labeled as either "living" or "deceased" in participants.tsv
- No other demographic or clinical information (age, cognition, UPDRS, disease duration, etc.) is included per data-sharing guidelines.
- All participant IDs are anonymized following BIDS convention (e.g., sub-PD1301).

   - No other demographic or clinical information (age, cognition, UPDRS, disease duration, etc.) is included per data-sharing guidelines.
   - All participant IDs are anonymized following BIDS convention (e.g., sub-PD1301).
   
   EEG Acquisition Details:
   - Recording type: Resting-state EEG (eyes open)
   - Device: Clinical BrainVision EEG system
   - File formats: .vhdr, .eeg, .vmrk
   - Sampling rate: 500 Hz
   - Montage: Standard 10–20 international system
   - Recording condition: “task-rest” (no task)
   
   Data Organization:
   Data are structured following the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) EEG standard:
       sub-<ID>/
           ses-01/
               eeg/
                   sub-<ID>_ses-01_task-rest_eeg.vhdr

                   sub-<ID>_ses-01_task-rest_eeg.vmrk
   
   Mortality Label Format:
   - Living subjects: survival_status = "living"
   - Deceased subjects: survival_status = "deceased"
   
   Ethics & Privacy:
   All subjects provided consent for EEG recording at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. The publicly shared version here is fully de-identified and contains no clinical or personal health information other than mortality classification.
   
   Suggested Use:
   This dataset can be used to explore EEG biomarkers of mortality risk, EEG signal characteristics in PD, or to build machine learning models for classification.
