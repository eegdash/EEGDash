Description
-----------

Probabilistic Selection Task.  Unpublished!   Same sample as this published study: 10.1038/ncomms6394.
Study 1: 80 healthy participants + 5 placebo session from a pilot of the drug study.  Total n=85.   But Subj 173 might have bad EEG.
Study 2: 30 healthy participants (3 dropout) in a double-blind drug study.    Total n=27.   Drug was Cabergoline 1.25 mg.
If you look in the code folder at the .xls sheet, you'll see that subjects had different initial IDs.
Study 1 subjects had subject IDs 101-180 plus the 5 placebo runs from an early test of ultra-low-dose cabergoline: these pilot runs were subject # 301/401 | 305/405.   Study 2 subjects had IDs 306/406 | 335/435.   Why the odd ranges for the drug study?   Glad you asked.  The dual numbers were for session:  300s were first session, 400s were second session.  The last two digits were subject ID.  (here with the benefit of BIDS formatting we have simply put them in as session 1 and session 2 with unique sub-#, which is BETTER).
For example.  Joe Smith would have been 305 on visit 1, then 405 on visit 2.   Jane Henderson would have been 306 on visit 1, then 406 on visit 2.   Whatever visit got cab or placebo is indicated in the .xls sheet as well as on the Sess1_Drug and Sess2_Drug columns in the main .tsv file.
Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2012-2013 in Laboratory for Neural Computation & Cognition at Brown.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   A few old analysis scripts are included.  - James F Cavanagh 02/15/2021
UPDATES:
1) Uploaded a .json sidecar developed by EEGLab for NEMAR indexing:  task-PST_events.json
2) Since this was updated, I had to erase each subject's *_events.json files.
3) Note that the Reward and Penalty feedback labels ('FB: 0' and 'FB: +1') are incorrect here.   The actual feedback was 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect.'   I'm just going to leave those as-is in the files since it doesn't change too much.  Run the task (under /stimuli) to see what the feedbacks look like.
4) there was a bug in the original task description that indicated this as 'Simon Conflict'.  This is not that task.  This is a Probabilistic Selection Task.  These should have been changed to PST, but if you see SimonConflict just realize that was an original mis-label.
