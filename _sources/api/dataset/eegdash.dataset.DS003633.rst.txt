Description
-----------

**ForrestGump-MEG: A audio-visual movie watching MEG dataset**

For details please refer to our paper on https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.446837v1.

This dataset contains MEG data recorded from 11 subjects while watching the 2h long Chinese-dubbed audio-visual movie 'Forrest Gump'. The data were acquired with a 275-channel CTF MEG. Auxiliary data (T1w) as well as derivation data such as preprocessed data and MEG-MRI co-registration are also included. 

Please noted that For sub-01, the MEG machine collapsed at the 500th second in run 7 (segment 7), a supplementary run (run 8, segment 7, 200 s) was recorded subsequently after the collapse. So there are 9 runs in total for sub-01 with run 7&8 for segment 7 and run 9 for segment 8.

   **ForrestGump-MEG: A audio-visual movie watching MEG dataset**
   
   For details please refer to our paper on https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.446837v1.
   
   This dataset contains MEG data recorded from 11 subjects while watching the 2h long Chinese-dubbed audio-visual movie 'Forrest Gump'. The data were acquired with a 275-channel CTF MEG. Auxiliary data (T1w) as well as derivation data such as preprocessed data and MEG-MRI co-registration are also included. 
   
   Please noted that For sub-01, the MEG machine collapsed at the 500th second in run 7 (segment 7), a supplementary run (run 8, segment 7, 200 s) was recorded subsequently after the collapse. So there are 9 runs in total for sub-01 with run 7&8 for segment 7 and run 9 for segment 8. 
   
   
   **Pre-process procedure description**
   
   The T1w images stored as NIFTI files were minimally-preprocessed using the anatomical preprocessing pipeline from fMRIPrep with default settings. 
   
   MEG data were pre-processed using MNE following a three-step procedure: 1. bad channels were detected and removed. 2. a high-pass filter of 1 Hz was applied to remove possible slow drifts from the continuous MEG data. 3. artifacts removal was performed with ICA.
   
   
   **Stimulus material**
   
   The audio-visual stimulus materials were from the Chinese-dubbed 'Forrest Gump' DVD released in 2013 (ISBN: 978-7-7991-3934-0), which cannot be publicly released due to copyright restrictions. The stimulus materials are available upon reasonable request and on condition of a research-only data use agreement (correspondence with Xingyu Liu, liuxingyu987@foxmail.com).
   
   
   **Dataset content overview**
   
   the data were organized following the MEG-BIDS using MNE-BIDS toolbox.
   
   *the pre-processed MEG data*
   
   The preprocessed MEG recordings including the preprocessed MEG data, the event files, the ICA decomposition and label files and the MEG-MRI coordinate transformation file are hosted here.
