Description
-----------

The experiment consisted of two tasks: the main instruction-following task and an additional localizer task. The data of each participant was recorded in one session.
 
 
For the main instruction-following task, participants saw four sequential screens -screen display of 200 ms and 800 ms as interscreen interval- that contained the full instruction, after a pretarget interval, they were presented with the target images -two images framed by a colored shape, on display for 200 ms-. 
They had to respond if the instruction was fulfilled or not by the targets.
 
The first two screens of the instruction indicated if the participant had to pay attention to both images -integration- or to just one -selection-, and which specific images were set to appear -animate or inanimate images per trial-.
The third instruction refered to the relevant feature they had to pay attention to, either the color or the shape surrounding the image.
The last instruction indicated the key to press if the instruction was fulfilled by the target images -either “A” or “L”-. 
 
Each trial consisted of a novel combination of the instruction components. 
 
 
Additional catch trials were added, to ensure that participants were maintaining all information.
If any of the target images was different from the ones previously instructed, the participant had to indicate it by pressing both “A” and “L” simultaneously.
 
 
The localizer task was a 1-back task. Participants saw one target image per trial, and they had to indicate with a keypress -“A” and “L”- if the image was from the same subcategory as the image from the previous trial.
 
 
Each block of the main instruction-following task consisted of 32 trials, with a total of 16 blocks. 
All the conditions were fully counterbalanced to ensure no statistical dependencies within the blocks. 
 
Each of the 8 localizer blocks consisted of 40 trials.
 
To counterbalance the presentation of the blocks for the whole experiment session, the blocks of the main task were further divided according to the features -blocks of features 1 and blocks of features 2-,and then the sequence of main task and localizer blocks was counterbalanced.
