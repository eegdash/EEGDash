   **SRM Resting-state EEG**
   
   
   
   **Introduction**
   
   
   This EEG dataset contains resting-state EEG extracted from the experimental
   paradigm used in the *Stimulus-Selective Response Modulation* (SRM) project at
   the Dept. of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway.
   
   The data is recorded with a BioSemi ActiveTwo system, using 64 electrodes
   following the positional scheme of the extended 10-20 system (10-10).
   Each datafile comprises four minutes of uninterrupted EEG acquired while the
   subjects were resting with their eyes closed. The dataset includes EEG from
   111 healthy control subjects (the "t1" session), of which a number underwent
   an additional EEG recording at a later date (the "t2" session). Thus, some
   subjects have one associated EEG file, whereas others have two.
   
   
   **Disclaimer**
   
   
   The dataset is provided "as is". Hereunder, the authors take no responsibility
   with regard to data quality. The user is solely responsible for ascertaining
   that the data used for publications or in other contexts fulfil the required
   quality criteria.
   
   
   
   
   **The data**
   
   
   
   **Raw data files**
   
   
   The raw EEG data signals are rereferenced to the average reference. Other than
   that, no operations have been performed on the data. The files contain no
   events; the whole continuous segment is resting-state data. The data signals
   are unfiltered (recorded in Europe, the line noise frequency is 50 Hz). The
   time points for the subject's EEG recording(s), are listed in the \*_scans.tsv
   file (particularly interesting for the subjects with two recordings).
   
   Please note that the quality of the raw data has **not** been carefully
   assessed. While most data files are of high quality, a few might be of poorer
   quality. The data files are provided "as is", and it is the user's
   esponsibility to ascertain the quality of the individual data file.
   
   
   
   **/derivatives/cleaned_data**
   
   
   For convenience, a cleaned dataset is provided. The files in this derived
   dataset have been preprocessed with a basic, fully automated pipeline (see
   /code/s2_preprocess.m for details) directory for details. The derived files are
   stored as EEGLAB .set files in a directory structure identical to that of the
   raw files. Please note that the *\*_channels.tsv* files associated with the
   derived files have been updated with status information about each channel
   ("good" or "bad"). The "bad" channels are – for the sake of consistency –
   interpolated, and thus still present in the data. It might be advisable to
   remove these channels in some analyses, as they (per definition) do not provide
   anything to the EEG data. The cleaned data signals are referenced to the
   average reference (including the interpolated channels).
   
   Please mind the automatic nature of the employed pipeline. It might not perform
   optimally on all data files (*e.g.* over-/underestimating proportion of bad
   channels). For publications, we recommend implementing a more sensitive
   cleaning pipeline.
   
   
   
   **Demographic and cognitive test data**
   
   
   The *participants.tsv* file in the root folder contains the variables age,
   sex, and a range of cognitive test scores. See the sidecar participants.json
   for more information on the behavioural measures. Please note that these
   measures were collected in connection with the "t1" session recording.
