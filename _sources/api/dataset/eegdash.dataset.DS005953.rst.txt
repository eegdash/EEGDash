   **Task Description**
   
   Subjects were presented with images presented on a computer screen. The images spanned about 25x25 degrees of visual angle. Subjects fixated on a dot in the center of the screen that alternated between red and green, changing colors at random times. Subject 1 pressed a button when the fixation dot changed color. Subject 2 fixated on the dot but did not make manual responses because these responses were found to interfere with visual fixation.
   
   **Dataset and Stimuli**
   
   This data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. A community- driven specification for organizing neurophysiology data along with its metadata. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
   Each subject has their own folder (e.g., `sub-01`) which contains the raw EcoG data for that subject, as well as the metadata needed to understand the raw data and event timing. In addition, the `stimuli/` folder contains the .png files of the presented images.
   
   **Stimuli**
   
   Stimuli including high contrast vertical gratings (0.16, 0.33, 0.65, or 1.3 duty cycles per degree square wave) and noise patterns (spectral power distributions of k/f^4; k/f^2; and k/f^0).
   
   **Raw data**
   
   Raw data is stored with the Brainvision data format. This can be read in to memory with the following tools:
   * Python: The `pybv` package (https://github.com/bids-standard/pybv)
   * Matlab: BrainVision analyzer (https://www.mathworks.com/products/connections/product_detail/brainvision-analyzer.html)
