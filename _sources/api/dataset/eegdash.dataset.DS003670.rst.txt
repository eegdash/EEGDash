Description
-----------

**Synopsis**
This is the **GX dataset** formatted to comply with `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`__ standard format.
The tES/EEG/CTT/Vigilance experiment contains 19 unique participants (some repeated experiments).
Over a 70 min period EEG/ECG/EOG were recorded concurrently with a `CTT <https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~scott/pdf/COMPTRACK.pdf>`__
where participants maintained a ball at the center of the screen
and were periodically stimulated (with low-intensity noninvasive brain stimulation) for 30 secs with combinations of 9 stimulation montages.
For the **raw data** please see: https://zenodo.org/record/4456079
For methodological details please see corresponding article titled:
    **Dataset of concurrent EEG, ECG, and behavior with multiple doses of transcranial Electrical Stimulation**
**Data Descriptor Abstract**
We present a dataset combining human-participant high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with physiological and continuous behavioral metrics during transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Data include within participant application of nine High-Definition tES (HD-tES) types, targeting three cortical regions (frontal, motor, parietal) with three stimulation waveforms (DC, 5 Hz, 30 Hz); more than 783 total stimulation trials over 62 sessions with EEG, physiological (ECG, EOG), and continuous behavioral vigilance/alertness metrics. Experiment 1 and 2 consisted of participants performing a continuous vigilance/alertness task over three 70-minute and two 70.5-minute sessions, respectively. Demographic data were collected, as well as self-reported wellness questionnaires before and after each session. Participants received all 9 stimulation types in Experiment 1, with each session including three stimulation types, with 4 trials per type. Participants received 2 stimulation types in Experiment 2, with 20 trials of a given stimulation type per session. Within-participant reliability was tested by repeating select sessions. This unique dataset supports a range of hypothesis testing including interactions of tDCS/tACS location and frequency, brain-state, physiology, fatigue, and cognitive performance.
