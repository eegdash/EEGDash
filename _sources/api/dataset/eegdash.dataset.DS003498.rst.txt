Description
-----------


**Zurich iEEG HFO Dataset**

This dataset was obtained from the publication [1].
There are 20 subjects with HFO events. We converted the dataset into BIDS format.
The original uploader: adam2392 obtained explicit permission from the authors of the dataset to upload this to openneuro. Adam worked on an open-source Python implementation of HFO detection algorithms, and uses this dataset in validation. Even though the publication involves a ``Morphology`` HFO detector, we have implemented our interpretation of the RMS, LineLength and Hilbert detectors in the [mne-hfo repository] (https://github.com/adam2392/mne-hfo) [2].For more information, visit: https://github.com/adam2392/mne-hfo.

**Note from the paper**

"We excluded all electrode contacts where electrical stimulation evoked motor or language responses (Table S1).

   **Zurich iEEG HFO Dataset**

   **Note from the paper**
   
   "We excluded all electrode contacts where electrical stimulation evoked motor or language responses (Table S1).
   In TLE patients, we included only the 3 most mesial bipolar channels".
   
   **BIDS Conversion**
   
   MNE-BIDS was used to convert the dataset into BIDS format. The code inside `code/` was used to generate the
   data.
   
   **HFO Events From Original Paper**
   
   The HFO events from the original paper that were validated and detected are stored in the `*events.tsv` file per dataset run. The format is similar to ``mne-hfo`` and can be easily read in using ``mne-bids`` and/or ``mne-python``.
   Each row in the events.tsv file corresponds to a HFO detected in the original source dataset. The ``trial_type`` column stores the information pertaining type of HFO (e.g. ``ripple``, ``fr`` for fast ripple, or ``frandr`` for fast ripple and ripple). The channel name (possibly in bipolar reference) is `"-"` character delimited and appended to the type of HFO with a `"_"` separating. For example: ``<hfo_type>_<channel_name>`` is the form.
