Description
-----------

EEG recordings during sham neurofeedback in virtual reality

Description

This dataset contains EEG recordings acquired during a sham neurofeedback experiment conducted in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The study aimed to investigate how feedback valence (positive, negative, or control) modulates alpha-band activity and during an attentional task. EEG signals were recorded using a 32-channel SynAmps RT amplifier (Compumedics NeuroScan Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA) and Ag/AgCl passive electrodes mounted on an elastic cap (Wuhan Greentek Pty. Ltd., China) following the extended 10–20 international system.

Each participant completed four conditions:

Positive feedback (S##_p.cnt) - sham feedback with a reinforcement valence.

   EEG recordings during sham neurofeedback in virtual reality
   
   Description
   
   This dataset contains EEG recordings acquired during a sham neurofeedback experiment conducted in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The study aimed to investigate how feedback valence (positive, negative, or control) modulates alpha-band activity and during an attentional task. EEG signals were recorded using a 32-channel SynAmps RT amplifier (Compumedics NeuroScan Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA) and Ag/AgCl passive electrodes mounted on an elastic cap (Wuhan Greentek Pty. Ltd., China) following the extended 10–20 international system.
   
   Each participant completed four conditions:
   
   Positive feedback (S##_p.cnt) - sham feedback with a reinforcement valence.
   
   Negative feedback (S##_n.cnt) - sham feedback with a punishment valence.
   
   Control (S##_c.cnt) — participants observed the VR environment without any feedback.
   
   Resting-state (S##_resting.cnt) — participants alternated between eyes open and eyes closed conditions.
   
   Experimental design
   
   Feedback blocks: Each feedback condition consisted of four blocks of approximately 2 minutes each.
   
   Events:
   
   238 — marks the beginning of each 2-minute feedback block.
   
   222 — indicates an increase in brightness or volume of VR objects.
   
   190 — indicates a decrease in brightness or volume.
   
   126 — marks the beginning and end of eyes open/closed periods during the resting condition.
   
   Resting-state order: Eyes open first, followed by eyes closed.
   
   Data format
   
   Original EEG recordings were collected in .cnt format (NeuroScan).
   
   Data were converted to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format using the MNE-BIDS toolbox (Appelhoff et al., 2019).
   
   Each subject folder (e.g., sub-01/) contains EEG data files (.eeg), event markers, and corresponding JSON sidecar files with acquisition parameters.
   
   Data availability
   
   The BIDS-formatted dataset is publicly available on the OpenNeuro repository and linked through the OSF Wiki project.
