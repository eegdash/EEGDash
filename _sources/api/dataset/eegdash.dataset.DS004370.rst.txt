Description
-----------


**Dataset description**

This dataset consists of 6 patients age 13-53 years old where Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials (CCEPs) were recorded with Electro-CorticoGraphy (ECoG) during single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in the awake patient for clinical routine (SPES-clinical) and under general propofol-anesthesia (SPES-propofol).
For a detailed description see:
- The effect of propofol on local effective brain networks (submitted). D. van Blooijs, S. Blok, G.J.M. Huiskamp, P. van Eijsden, H.G.E. Meijer, F.S.S. Leijten
The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee from the UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands.

   **Data organization**
   
   This data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. A community-driven specification for organizing neurophysiology data along with its metadata. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
   Each patient has their own folder (e.g., `sub-PRIOS01` to `sub-PRIOS09`) which contains the iEEG recordings data for that patient, as well as the metadata needed to understand the raw data and event timing.
   Data are logically grouped in the same BIDS session and stored across runs indicating the day and time point of recording during the monitoring period.
   We use the optional run key-value pair to specify the day and the start time of the recording (e.g. run-021315, day 2 after implantation, which is day 1 of the monitoring period, at 13:15).
   The task key-value pair in long-term iEEG recordings describes the patient's state during the recording of this file. The task label is “SPESclin“ when these files contain data collected during clinical single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) and "SPESprop" when these files contain data collected during single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in the operating room.
   Electrode positions were estimated by running Freesurfer on the individual subject MRI scan. All shared electrode positions were converted to MNI305 space using the Freesurfer surface based non-linear transformation. We note that this surface based transformation distorts the dimensions of the grids, but maintains the gyral anatomy.
