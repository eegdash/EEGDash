   Title: EEG from a Brain-Computer Music Interface for controlling music tempo.
   
   Description: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2014a; 2014b) (please see Section 5 for full references). The dataset is obtained from a music-based Brain-Computer Interface constructed to allow users to modulate the tempo of a piece of music dynamically via intentional control. The dataset contains the electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 19 healthy participants instructed to increase the tempo of the music via kinaesthetically imagining squeezing a ball in their right hand or decrease the tempo by relaxing. The paradigm was split into 9 runs. The first was a calibration run, containing 30 trials in pairs of increase and decrease tempo trials.
