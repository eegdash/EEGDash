   EEG Raw and processed data for a memory task presented in virtual reality, 
   
   The full task is on OSF: https://osf.io/s9xmu/files
   
   Derivatives:
   
   Behavioral data from the task in derivatives
   
   Processed data is in the derivatives 
   
   Code
   
   Event codes are listed in the code file
   
   Trial function, preprocessing, data cleaning and analysis are also in the code file as .txt files which can be converted back to .m files. 
   
   The code uses information contained in matlab data files: layout_64WG.mat and neighbours.mat  due to the structure of these, they have been uploaded as .mat files. 
   
   Task:
   
   Wearing a head mounted display to display the task in virtual reality participants completed a visual working memory task 
   In the task they had to remember the status of and details about presented objects. 
   
   A person or a stick cued the items such that it could look left or right and items could appear on the left or right. Sometimes the cue was valid (i.e. pointed where objects appeared) and sometimes it was invalid (pointed away from where objects appeared) 
   
   The objects were always a bowl, a cup, a plate and a teapot. Each could have a different status that needed to be remembered 
   participants were probed on memory for item location and then item status
   
   
   Event codes within the data set are as follows. Trial function is included in code folder. 
   
   For the avatar cue
   
   s3021 Character shown - i.e. moment the avatar appears
   
   s3022 Objects shown - i.e. moment that the memory targets appear
   
   s3023 Maintenance interval - i.e. moment the memory objects leave the screen and the blank maintenance interval occurs
   
   s3024 Probe object shown - i.e. moment that participant is presented with location probe
   
   s3025 Resp 1 made - i.e. moment that the participants have responded to the location probe
   
   s3026 Q2 shown - i.e. moment that participants are asked a question about the status of the objects
   
   s3027 Resp 2 made - i.e. moment that the participants have responded to the status probe
   
   
   For the stick cue
   
   s3041 Stick shown - i.e. moment the stick appears
   
   s3042 Objects shown - i.e. moment that the memory targets appear
   
   s3043 Maintenance interval - i.e. moment the memory objects leave the screen and the blank maintenance interval occurs
   
   s3044 Probe object shown - i.e. moment that participant is presented with location probe
   
   s3045 Resp 1 made - i.e. moment that the participants have responded to the location probe
   
   s3046 Q2 shown - i.e. moment that participants are asked a question about the status of the objects
   
   s3047 Resp 2 made - i.e. moment that the participants have responded to the status probe
