   EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer: online real-time control.
   Description: This dataset accompanies the publication by Daly et al. (2018) and has been analysed in Daly et al. (2016) (please see Section 5 for full references). The purpose of the research activity in which the data were collected was to investigate the performance of a real-time and online brain-computer interface that identified the user’s emotional state and modified music on-the-fly in order to induce a target emotional state. For this purpose, participants listened to 60 s music clips targeting different affective states, as defined by valence and arousal. The music clips were generated using a synthetic music generator. The dataset contains the EEG data from 8 healthy adult participants during real-time control of the system while listening to the music clips, together with the reported affective state (valence and arousal values).
   This dataset is connected to 2 additional datasets:
   1.	EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer Interface: system calibration. doi:
   2.	EEG data from an affective Music Brain-Computer: offline training data to induce target emotional states. doi:
   Please note that the number of participants varies between datasets; however, participant codes are the same across all three datasets.

   **4. CONTENTS**
   
   The dataset comprises data from 8 subjects. The sampling rate is 1 kHz and the music listening task corresponding to a music clip is 60 s long (clip duration). During the first 20 s, the music clip places the listener in emotional state A, while for the remaining 40 s the music clip targets the affective trajectory from emotional state B to C.
   Within a 60s music listening epoch there are two target affective states. In the first 20s the music is generated to target one affective state (target A), for the next 20s the BCMI attempts to (a) work out what affective state the participant is actually in, and (b) generate music to move them from this affective state to the next targetted affective state (target B), which is targetted for the last 20s of the 60s music listening epoch.
