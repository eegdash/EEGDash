Description
-----------


**The “Cognitive Electrophysiology in Socioeconomic Context in Adulthood” Dataset**



**Data Description**

This dataset comprises electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 127 young adults (18-30 years), along with retrospective objective and subjective indicators of childhood family socioeconomic status (SES), as well as SES indicators in adulthood, such as educational attainment, individual and household income, food security, and home and neighborhood characteristics. The EEG data were recorded with tasks directly acquired from the Event-Related Potentials Compendium of Open Resources and Experiments ERP CORE (Kappenman et al., 2021), or adapted from these tasks (Isbell et al., 2024). These tasks, which are publicly available, were optimized to capture neural activity manifest in perception, cognition, and action, in neurotypical young adults. Furthermore, the dataset includes a symptoms checklist, consisting of questions that were found to be predictive of symptoms consistent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood, which can be used to investigate the links between ADHD symptoms and neural activity in a socioeconomically diverse young adult sample.



**Notes**

Before the data were publicly shared, all identifiable information was removed, including date of birth, race/ethnicity, zip code, and names of the languages the participants reported to speaking and understanding fluently. Date of birth was used to compute age in years, which is included in the dataset. The dataset consists of participants recruited for studies on adult cognition in context. To provide the largest sample size, we included all participants who completed at least one of the EEG tasks of interest. Each participant completed each EEG task only once. The original participant IDs with which the EEG data were saved were recoded and the raw EEG files were renamed to make the dataset BIDS compatible.
